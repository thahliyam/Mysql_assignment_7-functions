# Mysql_assignment_7-functions
This SQL assignment demonstrates a variety of data manipulation techniques and user-defined functions across two tables: Persons and Country. In the Persons table, a new DOB (Date of Birth) column is added with a DATE data type to store each individual’s birth date. To calculate age, a custom user-defined function CalculateAge is created, which takes the DOB as input and accurately calculates age by considering the year, month, and day difference from the current date. A SELECT query showcases the use of this function, retrieving each person’s PersonID, Name, DOB, and computed Age in the Persons table.

For the Country table, several string manipulation functions are used to analyze and transform the country names. The LENGTH function calculates the length of each country’s name, helpful for analyzing text length. The SUBSTRING function extracts the first three characters from each country’s name, allowing for prefix analysis or abbreviation purposes. Additionally, UPPER and LOWER functions are applied to convert each country name into uppercase and lowercase formats, which are useful for standardizing data or formatting it for specific reporting requirements. Together, these exercises provide a strong foundation in SQL, illustrating essential functions for date calculations and text processing that are common in database management and data analysis tasks.
